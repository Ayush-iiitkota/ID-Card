Describing Our Project:
We have created a website in which user can fill its information and can generate his Virtual ID Card within Few Minutes, It gives the control to User to Fill his Information Correctly and Upload his Best Photograph in which he looks Nice.
<br><br>
ID-Cards are Used in Almost Every Sector Like in Schools for Childrens and Staff, In Companies and Banks for employees ,etc.
<br><br>
Mainly For Those People Who Print ID-Card For These Organisations (Printing-Press). Its a hectic Process To Fill each and every information of user Manually with Their Images. It requires a lot of time and Effort and There is a possibility that the data entered by the Man Who is Typing 1000s of Data Daily Can be Mis-Matched or Deleted
or the Data can be Manipulated.
<br><br>
So For The Solution for the Above Problem is
Our Website Will Generate Virtual ID-Card in Digital Form Once the user fills its information.
And that Digital ID Card in pdf format will be given to printing-press and they have to click on the Print Button Only To Print The ID-Card.
